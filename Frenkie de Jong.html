      Frenkie de Jong (born 12 May 1997) is a Dutch professional footballer who
      plays as a midfielder for La Liga club Barcelona and the Netherlands
      national team. A versatile midfielder, he is known for his vision,
      passing, dribbling, technique, along with strong defensive abilities and
      attacking prowess. De Jong has frequently been ranked among the best
      midfielders in the world of football.[5][6][7][8][9][10] De Jong began his
      professional career at Willem II in 2015. He transferred to Ajax for a fee
      worth €1 a year later. The fee was symbolic and offset by a sell-on
      clause. At Ajax he established himself as one of the best young
      midfielders in Europe, after winning a domestic double and reaching the
      Champions League semi-finals. De Jong won the Eredivisie and KNVB Cup, was
      Eredivisie player of the season, and was an instrumental part of Ajax's
      first UEFA Champions League semi-final appearance in 22 years, in a
      breakthrough 2018–19 season. During his breakthrough season, De Jong
      agreed to sign for Barcelona in January 2019, leading him to be signed for
      the club in July, for a fee worth €75 million. De Jong was selected to the
      2019 FIFA FIFPro World11 and was one of three Dutch players to feature in
      it for the first time in five years. De Jong made his senior international
      debut for the Netherlands in September 2018. He became a starter in the
      inaugural UEFA Nations League, in which Netherlands finished runners-up.
      He also represented the side at UEFA Euro 2020. Contents 1 Club career 1.1
