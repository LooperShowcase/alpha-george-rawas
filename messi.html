      The No.10 is still searching for his first Ligue 1 goal following his
      summer arrival from Barcelona, so what's going wrong for the Argentine?
      When Lionel Messi hastily completed his summer move to Paris Saint-Germain
      on August 10, he probably did not expect that nearly three months on he
      would still be waiting for his first Ligue 1 goal. Adapting to the
      Champions League with his new side has not proven a problem. He has scored
      three goals in three games in Europeâ€™s elite competition, introducing
      himself formally to the Parc des Princes crowd with a trademark run and
      shot into the top corner against Manchester City before netting a double
      in the comeback win over RB Leipzig. In domestic competition, though, he
      has yet to score.
