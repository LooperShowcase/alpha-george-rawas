      Daniel Alves da Silva (born 6 May 1983), known simply as Dani Alves
      (Brazilian Portuguese: [ˈdɐ̃ni ˈawvis]), is a Brazilian professional
      footballer who plays as a right-back for La Liga club Barcelona and the
      Brazil national team. Considered one of the greatest defenders of all
      time, Alves is the most decorated player in the history of football with
      43 trophies at senior level.[3][4] Before joining Barcelona in 2008, Alves
      spent a successful six-year spell with Sevilla, winning two UEFA Cups and
      the Copa del Rey with the Andalusian side. He joined Barcelona for €32.5
      million,[5] becoming the third-most expensive defender of all-time. He won
      the treble in his first season with the club and in the next season, won
      the Supercopa de España, UEFA Super Cup and the FIFA Club World Cup.
      Additionally, he helped the club to clinch another two Supercopa de
      España, five La Liga titles and two UEFA Champions League titles in the
      years that followed. In 2016, Juventus signed Alves on a free transfer.[6]
      Alves won the 2016–17 Serie A title and 2016–17 Coppa Italia in his only
      season with the side, also reaching the Champions League Final.[7] In
      2017, Alves joined French side Paris Saint-Germain on a free transfer,
      winning a domestic treble in his first season, followed by another league
      title the following season.[8] In 2019, he returned to his home country,
      joining São Paulo. Two years later, Alves won his first title with the
      club, winning the Campeonato Paulista. He returned to Barcelona in 2021. A
      full international for Brazil since 2006, Alves was included in their
      squads for two FIFA World Cups and five Copa América tournaments, winning
      the 2007 and 2019 editions of the latter competition, as well as the 2009
      and 2013 FIFA Confederations Cups.
